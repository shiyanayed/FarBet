npm run compile
```

2. Deploy to Base Sepolia (testnet):
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
```

3. Deploy to Base Mainnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base
```

```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and connect your Base-compatible wallet
2. **Place a Bet**:
   - Select bet type (casts, likes, etc.)
   - Enter target user's FID (Farcaster ID)
   - Set your predicted value/threshold
   - Choose bet amount
   - Confirm transaction (base fee + bet amount)
3. **Track Bets**: View your active and resolved bets in "My Bets" tab
4. **Collect Winnings**: Winnings are automatically sent after bet resolution (minus 1.5% fee)

### For Frame Users

Share the frame on Farcaster:
- Frame URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/frame`
- Users can interact directly from their feed

## Bet Resolution

Bets are resolved automatically 24 hours after placement using the oracle system:

```bash
# Manual resolution via API
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/resolve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret": "your_cron_secret", "betId": 1}'
```

### Setting up Automated Resolution

Use a cron service (like Vercel Cron or GitHub Actions) to call the resolution endpoint:

```yaml
# Example: .github/workflows/resolve-bets.yml
name: Resolve Bets
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */1 * * *' # Every hour
jobs:
  resolve:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger resolution
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.APP_URL }}/api/resolve \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"secret": "${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}"}'

## Database Schema

### UserProfile
- `fid`: Farcaster ID
- `username`: Farcaster username
- `display_name`: Display name
- `wallet_address`: Primary Ethereum wallet
- `followers_count`: Number of followers
- `following_count`: Number of following

### MarketEvent
- `user_fid`: Target user's FID
- `market_type`: Type of prediction (casts_count, likes_total, engagement_score)
- `threshold`: Prediction threshold
- `direction`: Over or Under
- `status`: active, settled, cancelled
- `end_time`: When market closes
- `result_value`: Actual outcome (after settlement)
- `total_pool`: Sum of all bets

### Bet
- `market_id`: Related market
- `user_fid`: Bettor's FID
- `user_wallet`: Bettor's wallet
- `prediction`: Over or Under
- `amount`: Bet amount in USD
- `base_fee`: $0.20
- `payout`: Winnings (if won)
- `fee_on_win`: 1.5% fee on payout
- `status`: pending, active, won, lost
- `transaction_hash`: Blockchain transaction

### Withdrawal
- `user_fid`: User requesting withdrawal
- `user_wallet`: Target wallet
- `amount`: Withdrawal amount
- `status`: pending, processing, completed, failed
- `transaction_hash`: Withdrawal transaction

## Fee Model

### Base Fee ($0.20)
Charged when user places a bet, sent to:
```
0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC
```

### Win Fee (1.5%)
Charged when user withdraws winnings:
- Calculated: `winnings * 1.5 / 100`
- Sent to: `0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC`

### Example
- User bets: $10
- Base fee: $0.20
- Total cost: $10.20
- If user wins $20
- Win fee: $0.30 (1.5%)
- User receives: $19.70

## Payout Calculation

Payouts are calculated using a pool-based system:

```
Losing Pool = (Total Pool) * 0.7
Payout per Winner = (Losing Pool / Number of Winners) + Original Bet
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Wallet Verification**: All transactions require verified Farcaster wallet
2. **Transaction Signing**: Private key never exposed to client
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated server-side
5. **Database**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent SQL injection

## Supported Networks

- **Ethereum Mainnet** (Chain ID: 1)
- **Ethereum Sepolia** (Chain ID: 11155111) - For testing

## Testing

### Run tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Test environment
Create `.env.test` for testing configuration:
```env
CHAIN_ID=11155111  # Sepolia
# ... other test config
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "project.py"]
```

### Vercel Deployment
```bash
vercel deploy
```

### AWS Lambda
Use AWS Lambda with Flask API Gateway integration.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Database Indexing**: Indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Caching**: Cache user profiles and market data
3. **Batch Processing**: Process market settlements in batches
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-chain support (Polygon, Arbitrum)
- [ ] Advanced betting options (parlays, teasers)
- [ ] Leaderboards and rankings
- [ ] Social trading features
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Automated market maker (AMM)
- [ ] Options markets

### Farcaster Stats
```
GET /api/farcaster/stats?fid=<user_fid>&type=<stat_type>
```

### User Bets
```
GET /api/bets?address=<wallet_address>
```

### Specific Bet
```
GET /api/bets?betId=<bet_id>
```

### Resolve Bet
```

## Smart Contract Functions

### Place a Bet
```solidity
function placeBet(
    uint256 _fid,
    BetType _betType,
    uint256 _predictedValue,
    uint256 _betAmount
) external payable returns (uint256)
```

### Resolve a Bet (Owner/Oracle)
```solidity
function resolveBet(
    uint256 _betId,
    uint256 _actualValue
) external onlyOwner
```

### Get User Bets
```solidity
function getUserBets(address _user) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
```

## Fee Configuration

Fees are hardcoded in the smart contract:
- **BASE_FEE**: 0.2 ether (adjust based on ETH price)
- **WINNING_FEE_PERCENT**: 150 basis points (1.5%)

To change fees, update the contract and redeploy.

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ ReentrancyGuard protection on bet placement and resolution
- ‚úÖ Owner-only access for bet resolution
- ‚úÖ Overflow protection with Solidity 0.8+
- ‚úÖ Input validation on all user inputs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Oracle centralization (consider Chainlink for production)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ETH price volatility affects fee values

## Testing

```bash
# Run contract tests
npx hardhat test

# Run with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS to your Farcaster wallet
- [ ] Deploy contract to Base network
- [ ] Update NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
- [ ] Configure Neynar API key
- [ ] Set up oracle wallet for automated resolution
- [ ] Configure cron job for bet resolution
- [ ] Test on testnet first (Base Sepolia)
- [ ] Verify contract on BaseScan
