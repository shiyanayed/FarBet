## Fee Model

### Base Fee ($0.20)
Charged when user places a bet, sent to:
```
0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC
```

### Win Fee (1.5%)
Charged when user withdraws winnings:
- Calculated: `winnings * 1.5 / 100`
- Sent to: `0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC`

### Example
- User bets: $10
- Base fee: $0.20
- Total cost: $10.20
- If user wins $20
- Win fee: $0.30 (1.5%)
- User receives: $19.70

## Payout Calculation

Payouts are calculated using a pool-based system:

```
Losing Pool = (Total Pool) * 0.7
Payout per Winner = (Losing Pool / Number of Winners) + Original Bet
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Wallet Verification**: All transactions require verified Farcaster wallet
2. **Transaction Signing**: Private key never exposed to client
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated server-side
5. **Database**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent SQL injection

## Supported Networks

- **Ethereum Mainnet** (Chain ID: 1)
- **Ethereum Sepolia** (Chain ID: 11155111) - For testing

## Testing

### Run tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Test environment
Create `.env.test` for testing configuration:
```env
CHAIN_ID=11155111  # Sepolia
# ... other test config
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "project.py"]
```

### Vercel Deployment
```bash
vercel deploy
```

### AWS Lambda
Use AWS Lambda with Flask API Gateway integration.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Database Indexing**: Indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Caching**: Cache user profiles and market data
3. **Batch Processing**: Process market settlements in batches
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
