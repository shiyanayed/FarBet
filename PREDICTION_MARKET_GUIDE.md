The platform includes interactive Farcaster Frames for seamless UX:

### Available Frames

1. **Markets Frame** (`/frame/markets`)
   - Display active prediction markets
   - Quick navigation to create or bet

2. **Create Market Frame** (`/frame/create-market`)
   - Simple form to create new predictions
   - Format: `@username market_type threshold hours`
   - Example: `@alice casts_count 5 24`

3. **Place Bet Frame** (`/frame/place-bet`)
   - Interactive bet placement
   - Real-time fee calculation
   - Wallet integration

4. **My Bets Frame** (`/frame/my-bets`)
   - View all user's bets
   - See bet status and payouts
   - Quick access to withdrawals

5. **Withdraw Frame** (`/frame/withdraw`)
   - Show available balance
   - Request withdrawals
   - Confirm transaction

## Example Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Market
```bash
POST /api/markets/create
{
  "user_fid": 1234,
  "market_type": "casts_count",
  "threshold": 5,
  "direction": "over",
  "duration_hours": 24
}
# Returns: market_id = 1
```

### Step 2: Place a Bet
```bash
POST /api/bets/place
{
  "market_id": 1,
  "user_fid": 5678,
  "prediction": "over",
  "amount": 10.0,
  "user_wallet": "0x1234567890..."
}
# Charges: $10.20 ($10.00 bet + $0.20 fee)
# Returns: bet_id = 1
```

### Step 3: Wait for Market End
- Market ends after 24 hours
- System fetches actual user metrics

### Step 4: Settle Market
```bash
POST /api/markets/1/settle
# Compares actual value vs threshold
# Determines winners
# If user won, payout includes amount but loses 1.5% on withdrawal
```

### Step 5: Withdraw Winnings
```bash
POST /api/withdrawals/request
{
  "user_fid": 5678,
  "user_wallet": "0x1234567890...",
  "amount": 15.0  # Their share of winnings
}
# Actually charged: $14.775 ($15.00 - 1.5% fee)
# Fee destination: 0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC
```

## Technical Architecture

### Database Models

1. **UserProfile**: Farcaster user information
2. **MarketEvent**: Prediction market details
3. **Bet**: Individual bet placement
4. **Withdrawal**: Withdrawal requests and history
5. **Transaction**: Audit trail for all transactions

### Development Mode

Current deployment uses stubbed blockchain for development:
- Mock wallet transactions
- Simulated fee transfers
- Development transaction hashes
- Database-only settlement

### Production Deployment

For production with real blockchain:
1. Replace stubbed blockchain.py with web3 implementation
2. Configure Alchemy RPC URL
3. Set PRIVATE_KEY for transaction signing
4. Use actual USDC contract
5. Deploy to Ethereum mainnet

## Configuration

Environment variables in `.env`:
```
FARCASTER_HUB_URL=https://hub.farcaster.builders
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_api_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///prediction_market.db
ALCHEMY_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/...
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
CHAIN_ID=1
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_prediction_market.py
```

Quick test:
```bash
python quick_test.py
```
