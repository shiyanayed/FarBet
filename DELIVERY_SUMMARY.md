**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE & DELIVERED**
**Project**: Farcaster Prediction Market with Fee System

---

## 🎯 What You Requested

> Build a prediction market inside Farcaster where people can bet on how many casts a user will make in a day, how many overall likes a user will get after 24hr (either greater than or less than a certain amount), and other things that can be bet on. When a user wants to bet, charge a base fee of $0.20. If a user wins a bet, charge a 1.5% fee on the total win on withdrawal. Use the wallet associated with the Farcaster account for the bet (no deposits needed). Send all fees to wallet address 0xf2B6664bF4d507C8889f07174A6A6dE53CEFD7fC
