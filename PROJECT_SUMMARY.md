## Revenue Model

### Your Income Streams

1. **Base Fee**: $0.20 per bet
   - 1,000 bets = $200
   - 10,000 bets = $2,000
   - 100,000 bets = $20,000

2. **Winning Fee**: 1.5% of payouts
   - $10,000 in payouts = $150
   - $100,000 in payouts = $1,500
   - $1,000,000 in payouts = $15,000

### Example Scenario
- 1,000 users place average $10 bet
- 500 users win (50% win rate)
- Winnings: $5,000 total payout

**Your Revenue:**
- Base fees: 1,000 × $0.20 = $200
- Winning fees: $5,000 × 1.5% = $75
- **Total: $275**

## Important Notes

### Fee Collector Configuration
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Set `FEE_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS` in `.env` to YOUR wallet address connected to Farcaster. This is where ALL fees ($0.20 base + 1.5% winning) will be sent.

### Security Checklist
- ✅ Never commit `.env` file
- ✅ Use separate wallets for deployment, fees, and oracle
- ✅ Test on testnet first
- ✅ Start with low limits
- ✅ Monitor for suspicious activity
- ✅ Keep private keys secure

### Legal Considerations
⚠️ Gambling regulations vary by jurisdiction. Consult legal counsel before launching. This is experimental software - use at your own risk.

### Gas Fees
- Bet placement: ~$0.01-0.05 per transaction
- Resolution: Paid by oracle wallet
- Consider ETH price volatility
