└─ NO → Read deployment guide first

Do you want maximum control?
├─ YES → Use Docker (15-30 min)
└─ NO → Use Heroku or Railway (5 min)

Is this your first deployment?
├─ YES → Read QUICK_LAUNCH_GUIDE.md first

## 🚨 IMPORTANT SECURITY REMINDERS

⚠️ **NEVER DO THIS:**
```
❌ Commit .env to Git
❌ Share WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
❌ Put API keys in code
❌ Expose NEYNAR_API_KEY
❌ Disable environment variable protection
```

✅ **DO THIS INSTEAD:**
```
✅ Store keys in .env (add to .gitignore)
✅ Use hosting provider's secret management
✅ Keep backups of private key (encrypted)
✅ Rotate keys regularly
✅ Monitor wallet transactions
```
